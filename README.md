English Premier League Prediction AI
Overview
The English Premier League Prediction AI is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the outcomes of football matches in the English Premier League. The project uses historical match data, player statistics, and team performances to train machine learning models that predict whether a match will end in a win, loss, or draw.

By utilizing popular algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression, this project aims to provide accurate predictions of football matches, with the ultimate goal of helping fans, analysts, and betting enthusiasts make informed decisions.

The project is built using Streamlit for interactive data visualizations, allowing users to explore the data and make predictions through a simple web interface.

Features
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Load, clean, and preprocess historical Premier League match data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze various trends, such as home vs. away wins, most successful teams, etc.

Model Training: Train machine learning models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression to predict match outcomes.

Prediction Interface: Web-based interface where users can input match details (e.g., teams, home/away stats) to predict match results.

Data Visualizations: Display insightful charts like win percentages, team performance, and feature correlations.

Real-time Predictions: Predict match outcomes based on input statistics for upcoming games.

Installation
Clone the repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ngoubimaximillian12/English-Premier-League-Prediction-AI.git
cd English-Premier-League-Prediction-AI
Set up a virtual environment
We recommend using a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. Here's how you can set it up:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies
After activating the virtual environment, install the required Python dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all necessary packages like Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

Usage
Run the Streamlit Application
Once all the dependencies are installed, you can run the app using Streamlit. The application allows you to interact with the model, perform predictions, and visualize the data.

To start the Streamlit app, use this command:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run PremierLeagueDataAnalysis.py
This will open the application in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Features Explained
1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
The dataset contains historical Premier League match data, including match results, team performance, goals scored, and other match statistics.

Missing data is handled, and features are engineered to prepare the data for model training.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps help analyze important trends and distributions, such as:

Most successful teams.

Home vs. away results.

Goals scored by teams over time.

3. Model Training
The project utilizes Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression to predict the outcome of football matches.

We evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Prediction Interface
Users can input match details, including:

Home team.

Away team.

Home team statistics (shots, possession, etc.).

Away team statistics.

The app will then predict whether the match will end in a win, loss, or draw.

5. Real-Time Data Visualizations
Interactive charts display the performance of teams over time, including:

Win rates for each team.

Distribution of goals scored by each team.

Correlation between various match statistics and outcomes.

Model Training
The machine learning model used for prediction is a Random Forest Classifier. Here’s a quick overview of how the model works:

Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and processed. Categorical features are encoded, and numerical features are normalized.

Model Training: The cleaned data is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained using the training data, and hyperparameters are tuned for better performance.

Evaluation: The model is evaluated on test data, and metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess performance.

We also provide the option to train the model on new or additional data by updating the results.csv file with new match data.

Data Sources
This project uses historical match data for the English Premier League. The data is sourced from:

Football Data: https://www.football-data.org/

SportsRadar API: For real-time data and player statistics.

Make sure to update the results.csv file with the latest match data to improve prediction accuracy.
